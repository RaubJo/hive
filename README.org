* How did I end up here?
I kept a list of programs that I had installed and was working on finding a program with which to manage all my meticulously crafted dotfiles while simultaneously jumping down the emacs rabbit hole, specifically [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]] (Thanks [[https://distro.tube/index.html][DistroTube]] !) I fell in love with the configuration system of Doom Emacs.

I then started watching [[https:systemcrafters.net][System Crafters]] on YouTube and was introduced to [[https:guix.gnu.org][Guix]] which I tried to install on an older laptop that needed proprietary software in order to have operable WiFi. I looked for something that allowed unfree software and binary blobs out of the box, behold, NixOs.

For the last seven years I had distro hopped: Ubuntu, Debian, Arch, Fedora, Arch again, Manjaro, now my pursuit of sanity is done. I failed. I give up and Nixos is my final computational resting place.

If you are looking at this repo, I don't think I need to explain what [[https://www.nixos.org][NixOS]] is. I will warn you, once you take the first step of configuring a system, /You Will Never Go Back/.

* System Configuration Overview
This configuration uses NixOs [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Flakes]] and the [[https://github.com/divnix/hive][Hive]] library/framework.

:NOTE: It is well worth your time to take a deep dive into nix. Studying the documentation and exploring in the nepl (nix repl). The learning curve is steep, but you already knew that. Go ahead and help yourself, instead of bumping around in the dark, turn on the lights.

** Hive
*** What is hive?
Hive is a Nixos system configuration flake with the naming convention around a beehive.
*** Why use Hive?
I use hive primarily because of its integration with [[https://github.com/divnix/std][std]].
*** What about Digga?
When I came across Divnix and [[https://github.com/divnix/digga][Digga]], I began to switch to it. I liked the organization of [[https://github.com/divnix/digga][Digga]] and it made sense while holding to the 'traditional' nix flake layout. At the same time whilst digging around in the Divnix repos I couldn't help notice Hive and [[https://github.com/divnix/std][std]]. As I read the Standard book (more than once) and played with it in 'nix repl' I decided to skip the [[https://github.com/divnix/digga][Digga]] config and use [[https://github.com/divnix/hive][Hive]], this was further solidified after watching all of the [[https://github.com/divnix/std][std]] videos (linked below).

These were what help me understand [[https://github.com/divnix/std][std]] the most. It makes sense of Hive's source code.
